## ✅ The FEDEVENT Solution (Even Better!)

### **Method 1: Fully Automated (⚡ INSTANT)**

1. Login to Admin Dashboard
2. Go to **Waitlist Tab**
3. Click **"🔄 Sync Registered"**
4. Click **"📊 Export to Excel"**
5. ✅ Done! All statuses are automatically updated

**Time:** 30 seconds
**Accuracy:** 100%

---

### **Method 2: Semi-Automated with XLOOKUP (📋 Like Gemini Suggested)**

#### **Step 1: Export Your Data (30 seconds)**

In FEDEVENT Admin Dashboard:
1. Click **"📊 Export to Excel"** → Downloads `hotel-waitlist-2025-10-12.xlsx`
   - This is your **MASTER LIST** with ALL contacts and their statuses
   
2. Click **"📥 Export Registered List"** → Downloads `registered-hotels-2025-10-12.xlsx`
   - This is your **LOOKUP LIST** with emails of people who completed registration

---

#### **Step 2: Setup Your Workbook (1 minute)**

1. Open `hotel-waitlist-2025-10-12.xlsx` (your master list)
2. At the bottom, click **+ to add a new sheet**
3. Name the new sheet: **`Registrations`**
4. Open `registered-hotels-2025-10-12.xlsx`
5. Copy the email column (Column A)
6. Paste into the `Registrations` sheet, Column A

Your workbook now has two sheets:
- **Hotel Waitlist** (main sheet with all your data)
- **Registrations** (just emails of registered users)

---

#### **Step 3: Add XLOOKUP Formula (2 minutes)**

In the **Hotel Waitlist** sheet:

1. Find an empty column (let's say Column W)
2. Add header: **"Registration Check"**
3. In cell W2, paste this formula:

```excel
=XLOOKUP(J2, Registrations!A:A, Registrations!A:A, "Not Found")
```

**What this does:**
- `J2` = Email address from your main list (adjust if your email column is different)
- `Registrations!A:A` = Look in the Registrations sheet, column A
- `"Not Found"` = Display this if no match

4. Press **Enter**
5. **Double-click** the small square at the bottom-right of cell W2
   - This copies the formula down to ALL rows automatically

---

#### **Step 4: Filter to See Who Registered (1 minute)**

1. Click the filter arrow on **"Registration Check"** column
2. **Uncheck** "(Select All)"
3. **Check** all the email addresses (everything EXCEPT "Not Found")
4. Click **OK**

Now you're looking at ONLY the people who have registered! 🎉

---

#### **Step 5: Bulk Update Status (30 seconds)**

1. Find your **"Registration Status"** column (Column U in the export)
2. Click the first cell in that column (below the header)
3. Type: **`Registered`**
4. Select that cell and drag down to the bottom of the filtered list
   - Or use Ctrl+D (Windows) / Cmd+D (Mac) to fill down

5. Click the filter arrow again and select **"All"** to see everyone again

✅ Done! Everyone who registered now shows "Registered" status!

## 🎯 XLOOKUP Formula Breakdown

```excel
=XLOOKUP(J2, Registrations!A:A, Registrations!A:A, "Not Found")
         │    │                 │                 │
         │    │                 │                 └─ Show this if no match
         │    │                 └─ Return the email if found
         │    └─ Look in this range (Registrations sheet, column A)
         └─ Search for this value (email from row 2)
```

### **Common Adjustments:**

If your email column is **Column E** instead of J:
```excel
=XLOOKUP(E2, Registrations!A:A, Registrations!A:A, "Not Found")
```

If you want to return the registration date instead:
```excel
=XLOOKUP(J2, Registrations!A:A, Registrations!C:C, "Not Found")
```
(Assuming registration date is in column C of Registrations sheet)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: XLOOKUP not working**
**Solution:** Your Excel version might be old. Use VLOOKUP instead:
```excel
=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(J2, Registrations!A:A, 1, FALSE), "Not Found")
```

### **Problem: Getting #N/A errors**
**Solution:** Wrap your formula:
```excel
=IFERROR(XLOOKUP(J2, Registrations!A:A, Registrations!A:A, "Not Found"), "Not Found")
```

### **Problem: Some emails not matching**
**Solution:** Trim whitespace:
```excel
=XLOOKUP(TRIM(J2), Registrations!A:A, Registrations!A:A, "Not Found")
```

### **Problem: Case sensitivity issues**
**Solution:** Convert to lowercase:
```excel
=XLOOKUP(LOWER(J2), LOWER(Registrations!A:A), Registrations!A:A, "Not Found")
```
