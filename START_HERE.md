## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Git Repository Issue

**What happened:**
Your git repository has corrupted objects causing bus errors. This is a hardware/filesystem issue, NOT a code problem.

**Good news:**
- ✅ All your code files are perfect
- ✅ Can still deploy via GitHub web interface
- ✅ Repository can be fixed later (optional)

**Solutions:**
- **Easy:** Upload files via GitHub web interface (recommended now)
- **Advanced:** Fix git corruption (see `ALTERNATIVE_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- **Alternative:** Create new repository for prelaunch only
