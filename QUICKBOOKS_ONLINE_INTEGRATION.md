## STEP 3: Get API Credentials (10 minutes)

---

## STEP 4: Install Required Packages (2 minutes)

Run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install intuit-oauth node-quickbooks
```

---

## STEP 5: Add Credentials to .env (2 minutes)

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# QuickBooks Online API Credentials
QB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
QB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
QB_REALM_ID=your_realm_id_here
QB_ENVIRONMENT=production
QB_REDIRECT_URI=https://fedevent.com/api/quickbooks/callback

# QuickBooks Settings
QB_ITEM_ID=1  # The product/service item ID from Step 2
QB_AUTO_SEND_INVOICE=true
```

**Security Note**: Never commit .env file to git!

---

## STEP 6: Implement OAuth Connection (I'll Add This Code)

This connects your website to QuickBooks (one-time setup).

I'll add this to your server.js - You'll just need to run it once.

---

## STEP 7: Test the Integration (5 minutes)

### Test Invoice Creation:
1. Register a test hotel on your site
2. Check QuickBooks: Sales ‚Üí Invoices
3. New invoice should appear for $49.99
4. Invoice should auto-email to hotel

### Test Payment:
1. Hotel receives invoice email
2. Clicks "Review and Pay"
3. Enters test card: `4111 1111 1111 1111`
4. Pays $49.99
5. Check your admin dashboard - should auto-activate
