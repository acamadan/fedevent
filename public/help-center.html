                        <li><strong>Based on Hotel Availability</strong> ‚Äì All reservations are made only if your hotel has availability at the time of request. You maintain full control of your inventory; no rooms are pre-blocked or guaranteed.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Minimum Room Commitment</strong> ‚Äì The Government is not requiring a fixed number of room nights. The BPA simply sets aside a rate for use when rooms are needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Rate (Similar to a Corporate Rate)</strong> ‚Äì Hotels that provide rates at or below per diem are preferred, and offering a discount of up to 30% below per diem is considered highly desirable, giving your property stronger positioning for selection.</li>
                        <li><strong>5-Year Lifecycle</strong> ‚Äì A BPA can last up to 5 years. Rates, terms, and conditions are reviewed annually and may be adjusted or renewed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplified Process</strong> ‚Äì Once the BPA is established, bookings are straightforward: the Government (through CREATA) places reservations as needed without renegotiating terms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Each Reservation is the Actual Contract</strong> ‚Äì While the BPA itself is not a contract, each order or reservation placed under it becomes binding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hotel Flexibility to Exit</strong> ‚Äì At the end of each yearly term, hotels may choose to cancel or not renew the BPA without penalty.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">Benefits for Your Hotel</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Preferred Vendor Status</strong> ‚Äì Being selected for a BPA means your hotel is pre-approved for Government business.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Pre-Allocation</strong> ‚Äì You are not required to block or hold rooms in advance. Bookings are always subject to your availability.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Volume Guarantees</strong> ‚Äì You won‚Äôt be forced into commitments or quotas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> ‚Äì Properties offering significant discounts (such as 30% off per diem) are prioritized, making them more attractive to Government buyers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-Term Opportunity</strong> ‚Äì A BPA secures your hotel a seat at the table for up to 5 years of recurring opportunities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplified Bookings</strong> ‚Äì Faster process, no need to renegotiate rates each time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Credibility</strong> ‚Äì Being awarded a BPA shows your hotel meets U.S. Government subcontractor standards.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Guaranteed Revenue</strong> ‚Äì While a BPA opens the door to Government bookings, there is no guarantee of volume.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate Obligation</strong> ‚Äì Your hotel must honor the agreed BPA rate, even in peak seasons.</li>
                        <li><strong>Annual Review</strong> ‚Äì Rates and conditions may be renegotiated each year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hotel Right to Cancel</strong> ‚Äì Hotels may exit the BPA at the end of any annual term if they no longer wish to participate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Terms</strong> ‚Äì Invoices are paid under NET30 (30 days after Government approval). No upfront deposits can be made.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance with CREATA Policies</strong> ‚Äì As the prime contractor, CREATA sets subcontractor requirements aligned with Government standards, including no direct bill application process and no direct contact with Government officials.</li>

                    <h4>Key Features of an FFP Contract</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Guaranteed Block of Rooms</strong> ‚Äì A specific number of rooms (and sometimes meeting spaces, meals, or other services) are reserved in advance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Rate</strong> ‚Äì The rate is negotiated and locked in at the beginning of the contract; it does not change regardless of seasonal fluctuations or hotel market conditions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guaranteed Revenue</strong> ‚Äì Because the Government commits to a fixed quantity, your hotel is assured of payment once services are delivered.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contract Term</strong> ‚Äì Typically tied to the dates of a conference, event, or program (e.g., 3 nights, 100 rooms, plus meeting space).</li>
                        <li><strong>Less Flexibility</strong> ‚Äì Unlike a BPA, you cannot cancel or change rates mid‚Äëcontract once it is signed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">Hotel‚ÄëFacing Explanation of a Firm‚ÄëFixed Price (FFP) Contract</h4>
                    <p>An FFP contract is a binding agreement between the U.S. Government (through CREATA Global as the prime contractor) and your hotel. Unlike a BPA, which is flexible and based on availability, an FFP contract establishes a set price and guaranteed room commitment for a specific program, event, or period.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">Benefits for Your Hotel</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Guaranteed Revenue</strong> ‚Äì A fixed number of rooms and services are contractually committed and paid for.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Availability Risk</strong> ‚Äì Rooms are blocked in advance, ensuring occupancy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Predictable Cash Flow</strong> ‚Äì Payments are based on a clear, pre‚Äëagreed price.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stronger Commitment</strong> ‚Äì Unlike a BPA, the Government must use the contracted rooms and services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event Stability</strong> ‚Äì Large conferences and programs often use FFP contracts, creating higher volume bookings.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">Considerations for Your Hotel</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Less Flexibility</strong> ‚Äì Once the contract is signed, your hotel must honor the rate and reserved block, even if higher‚Äëpaying customers inquire later.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strict Performance Standards</strong> ‚Äì You must deliver exactly what is promised (room type, meeting space, amenities) ‚Äî no substitutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Terms</strong> ‚Äì Payments are made under NET30 (30 days after invoice approval). No deposits or upfront payments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance with CREATA Policies</strong> ‚Äì As the prime contractor, CREATA enforces subcontractor rules aligned with U.S. Government standards, including no direct bill applications and no direct contact with Government officials (all communications go through CREATA).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">In Summary</h4>
                    <p>An FFP contract is like a guaranteed group booking at a fixed price:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Government commits to a set number of rooms/services at an agreed rate.</li>
                        <li>Your hotel secures guaranteed revenue but has less flexibility than with a BPA.</li>
                        <li>Prices are locked in, and obligations are binding once the contract is signed.</li>
                        <li>CREATA manages all compliance and payment processes as the prime contractor.</li>

                        <li><strong>Minimum Guarantee</strong> ‚Äì The Government guarantees at least a small quantity of bookings (e.g., a minimum of 10 rooms).</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum Ceiling</strong> ‚Äì There is a maximum quantity that may be ordered (e.g., up to 500 rooms over the contract).</li>
                        <li><strong>Task/Delivery Orders</strong> ‚Äì Instead of one big booking, the Government issues orders over time under the IDIQ as needs arise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Terms & Rates</strong> ‚Äì The negotiated rates apply to every order placed during the life of the IDIQ.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contract Term</strong> ‚Äì IDIQs often run for several years (commonly 3‚Äì5 years).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 style="margin-top: 12px;">Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract</h4>
                    <p>An IDIQ is a flexible Government contract used when the exact number of rooms, meeting spaces, or services needed is not known in advance. The Government (through CREATA Global as the prime contractor) commits to a minimum level of purchases and may order more, up to a stated maximum, during the contract period.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Guaranteed Minimum Revenue</strong> ‚Äì Unlike a BPA, an IDIQ includes a guaranteed minimum order, so you know you‚Äôll receive at least some business.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible Growth</strong> ‚Äì Orders can increase over time up to the maximum ceiling, giving you opportunities for significant revenue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long‚ÄëTerm Partnership</strong> ‚Äì Typically multi‚Äëyear, ensuring steady engagement with Government travel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplified Orders</strong> ‚Äì Once the contract is in place, each order is fast and straightforward under the same terms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Edge</strong> ‚Äì Hotels under IDIQ are in a stronger position for repetitive Government business compared to those without.</li>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Because the U.S. government issues purchase orders (POs) directly to CREATA Global. As the prime, CREATA manages subcontractors, ensures compliance, and distributes payments once federal funds are received.</p>

                    <p>No. Only CREATA Global, as the prime contractor, must be SAM.gov registered. Hotels and vendors are subcontractors and do not need their own SAM registration to participate.</p>
                    <p>If a hotel chooses to register with SAM.gov, that is perfectly fine ‚Äî but any contracts already awarded must still be fulfilled through CREATA Global Event Agency LLC. Hotels always act as subcontractors under CREATA for government task orders.</p>

                    <p>No. CREATA Global does not complete direct bill application processes.
