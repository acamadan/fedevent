## üîç Data Extraction Guidelines

### **What to Extract:**

1. **Hotel Name**
   - Look for property names in email signatures
   - Extract from "From:" field if domain matches hotel
   - Check email body for mentions like "at [Hotel Name]"
   - Clean up formatting (remove LLC, Inc., etc. unless part of brand)

2. **Contact Name**
   - Extract from email signature
   - Use "From:" name if available
   - Format: First Name Last Name
   - No titles (Dr., Mr., Ms.) in this field

3. **Email Address**
   - Primary contact email
   - Use "From:" address if it's personal
   - Skip generic addresses like info@, reservations@
   - Validate format (must have @ and domain)

4. **Title/Position**
   - Look in signature for role
   - Common titles: General Manager, Sales Director, Revenue Manager, Owner
   - Use exact title from signature

5. **Phone Numbers**
   - Extract personal cell from signature (Contact Phone)
   - Extract property main line (Hotel Phone)
   - Format: XXX-XXX-XXXX or (XXX) XXX-XXXX
   - Remove extensions if present

6. **Location**
   - Extract from signature or email body
   - City and State are most important
   - Country defaults to USA if not specified

7. **Communication Notes**
   - Summarize relationship/history
   - Note response quality: "Quick responder", "Detailed quotes", etc.
   - Flag any special terms: "Requires NET30", "30% discount accepted"
   - Include relevant dates: "Last quoted March 2024"
   - VIP status: "Platinum partner", "Referred by X", etc.

8. **Priority Level**
   - **high** = Frequent responder, large property, government contracts
   - **normal** = Standard contact
   - **urgent** = Hot lead, pending proposal, time-sensitive
