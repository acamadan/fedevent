## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Authentication failed"**

**Solution:**
1. Verify email exists in GoDaddy
2. Check password is correct
3. Ensure SMTP is enabled (GoDaddy enables by default)
4. Try alternative port 587

### **Problem: "Connection timeout"**

**Solution:**
1. Check firewall isn't blocking port 465
2. Verify SMTP_HOST is correct: `smtpout.secureserver.net`
3. Try port 587 with `SMTP_SECURE=false`

### **Problem: "Email sent but not received"**

**Solution:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify recipient email is correct
3. Check GoDaddy email sending limits
4. Review server logs for delivery status

### **Problem: "SMTP not configured"**

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `.env` file exists (not `.env.example`)
2. Restart your Node server after changing `.env`
3. Verify environment variables are loaded:
   ```bash
   node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.SMTP_HOST)"
   ```

## üß™ Testing Commands

### **Test 1: Basic Email Test**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/api/test-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"your-email@example.com"}'
```

### **Test 2: Full Lead Submission**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/api/leads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "hotelName": "Test Hotel",
    "city": "Boston",
    "state": "MA",
    "contactName": "Test User",
    "title": "Manager",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "interests": "lodging, conference"
  }'
```

This will trigger both confirmation and admin emails.

### **Test 3: Check Environment**
```bash
node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log({
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
  user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
  from: process.env.NOTIFY_FROM,
  to: process.env.NOTIFY_TO
})"
```

## üìß Email Best Practices

### **DO:**
‚úÖ Use `noreply@fedevent.com` for automated emails
‚úÖ Set Reply-To header to hotel's email in admin notifications
‚úÖ Include unsubscribe option in marketing emails
‚úÖ Monitor bounce rates
‚úÖ Keep email content professional

### **DON'T:**
‚ùå Use noreply@ email for two-way communication
‚ùå Send too many emails (spam complaints)
‚ùå Include sensitive data in emails
‚ùå Forget to test before production
‚ùå Hardcode email addresses in code

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### **Update .env for Production:**

```bash
# Production Email (same as development)
SMTP_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=noreply@fedevent.com
SMTP_PASS=SecurePassword123!

# Production URLs
BASE_URL=https://fedevent.com
NODE_ENV=production

# Production Recipients
NOTIFY_FROM=noreply@fedevent.com
NOTIFY_TO=admin@creata.com
```

### **Deploy to Hosting Platform:**

**For Render.com:**
1. Add environment variables in Render dashboard
2. Don't commit `.env` file to Git
3. Verify emails work after deployment

**For other platforms:**
- Add environment variables via platform's dashboard
- Test email functionality after deployment
- Monitor email delivery logs

## üìä Monitoring Email Delivery

### **Check GoDaddy Email Logs:**
1. Log in to GoDaddy Email Dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Email Activity
3. View sent/failed emails
4. Check bounce rates

### **Server Logs:**
```bash
# Watch server logs
tail -f server.log

# Search for email-related logs
grep -i "email" server.log

# Check for errors
grep -i "error.*mail" server.log
```

### **Common Email Events in Logs:**
- `Email sent successfully` - Delivery succeeded
- `Failed to send notification email` - Delivery failed
- `SMTP not configured` - Missing configuration
- `Authentication failed` - Wrong credentials

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### **Protect Your Credentials:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Use environment variables
SMTP_PASS=SecurePassword123!

# ‚ùå BAD - Hardcode in code
const pass = "SecurePassword123!";
```

### **Never Commit .env:**
```bash
# Check .gitignore includes:
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
```

### **Use Strong Passwords:**
- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of upper/lower case, numbers, symbols
- Don't reuse passwords
- Enable 2FA on GoDaddy account
