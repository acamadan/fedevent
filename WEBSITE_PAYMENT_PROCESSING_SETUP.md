#### Step 5: Update server.js

I'll add this code for you:

```javascript
import Stripe from 'stripe';
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// Create payment intent endpoint
app.post('/api/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount: 4999, // $49.99 in cents
      currency: 'usd',
      description: 'FEDEVENT Hotel Registration Setup Fee',
      metadata: {
        email: req.body.email,
        hotelName: req.body.hotelName,
      },
    });
    
    res.json({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Webhook for payment confirmation
app.post('/api/stripe/webhook', express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), async (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
  
  try {
    const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      req.body,
      sig,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
    );
    
    if (event.type === 'payment_intent.succeeded') {
      const paymentIntent = event.data.object;
      
      // Find and activate user account
      const payment = db.prepare(`
        SELECT * FROM payments 
        WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id = ?
      `).get(paymentIntent.id);
      
      if (payment) {
        // Mark as paid and activate account
        db.prepare(`UPDATE payments SET status = 'paid', paid_at = datetime('now') WHERE id = ?`).run(payment.id);
        db.prepare(`UPDATE users SET account_status = 'active', setup_fee_paid = 1 WHERE id = ?`).run(payment.user_id);
        
        // Send activation email
        console.log(`‚úÖ Account auto-activated via Stripe`);
      }
    }
    
    res.json({received: true});
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
  }
});
```

#### Step 6: Update Frontend (hotel-signup.html)

Add Stripe payment form (I'll do this for you when ready):

```html
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<script>
  const stripe = Stripe('your_publishable_key');
  // Payment form code here
</script>
```

**Total Setup Time:** 1-2 hours (I'll help!)
