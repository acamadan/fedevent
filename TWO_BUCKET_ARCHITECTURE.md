## 🔐 Duplicate Prevention

**System automatically prevents duplicates:**

```javascript
// During import to email_contacts:
1. Check: Is this email already in email_contacts?
   YES → Update existing record
   NO → Continue to step 2

2. Check: Is this email already in hotel_leads (waitlist)?
   YES → Skip (they already registered!)
   NO → Import to email_contacts

Result: No duplicates between buckets!
```

---

## 🔄 Auto-Link on Registration

**When hotel fills prelaunch form:**

```javascript
// server.js line ~3495
INSERT INTO hotel_leads (...) // Save to waitlist

// Then automatically:
SELECT id FROM email_contacts WHERE email = ?
IF FOUND:
  UPDATE email_contacts 
  SET registered = 'Yes',
      registered_lead_id = NEW_LEAD_ID

Result: 
- Hotel in waitlist ✅
- Email contact marked as converted ✅
- Full tracking maintained ✅
```
