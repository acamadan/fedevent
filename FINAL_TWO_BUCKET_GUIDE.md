# 🎉 TWO-BUCKET SYSTEM - FINAL GUIDE

## ✅ Architecture Problem: SOLVED!

**Issue:** Mixing invitation campaign contacts with registered waitlist  
**Solution:** Two separate buckets that auto-link when hotels register!

---

## 🏗️ The Two-Bucket System

### **BUCKET 1: Email Contacts** (Invitation Campaigns)
```
📧 email_contacts table
   ├─ Gemini's extracted emails
   ├─ Status: not_invited → invited
   ├─ Purpose: Send invitations
   └─ When registered → Links to Bucket 2
```

### **BUCKET 2: Waitlist** (Registered Hotels)
```
🎯 hotel_leads table
   ├─ Hotels who filled prelaunch form
   ├─ Status: registered
   ├─ Has ALL business terms
   └─ Includes: Direct signups + Email campaign converts
```

---

## 🔄 Complete Flow

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Tabs

### **Tab 1: Email Contacts** 📧
**Purpose:** Manage invitation campaigns

**Shows:**

- Not invited yet
- Invitations sent
- Registered (converted to waitlist!)

**Actions:**
- ☑️ Select contacts
- 📧 Send invitations (bulk with approval!)
- 📤 Import from CSV (Gemini's file)
- 📊 Export to Excel
- 🔍 Filter by status, priority
- 🔄 Refresh

**Filters:**
- Search (name, email, city)

---

### **Tab 2: Waitlist** 🎯
**Purpose:** View registered hotels

**Shows:**
- All hotels who completed registration
- Includes business terms (NET30, discount, etc.)
- Sources: Direct + Email campaigns

## 🛡️ Duplicate Prevention

**Automatically prevents mixing:**

```javascript
// During import to email_contacts:
1. Check: Is email in email_contacts?
   YES → Update existing
   NO → Check step 2

2. Check: Is email in hotel_leads (waitlist)?
   YES → Skip! (already registered)
   NO → Import

Result: Clean separation! No duplicates!
```

---

## 🔄 Auto-Link on Registration

**When hotel registers via prelaunch form:**

```sql
-- Save to waitlist
INSERT INTO hotel_leads (
  email, hotel_name, contact_name,
  indoor_property, accepts_net30, accepts_po, accepts_discount,
  interests, user_code
) VALUES (...)

-- Check if from email campaign
SELECT id FROM email_contacts WHERE email = ?

-- If found, auto-link
UPDATE email_contacts 
SET registered = 'Yes',
    registered_lead_id = NEW_LEAD_ID
WHERE email = ?
```

**Result:** 
- ✅ Hotel in waitlist with all business terms
- ✅ Email contact marked as converted
- ✅ Full tracking maintained
- ✅ Conversion metrics accurate
