## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - 3 SIMPLE STEPS

### Step 1: Upload to GitHub (5 minutes)

**Option A: Web Interface (Easiest)**

1. Open browser: https://github.com
2. Go to your `fedevent` repository
3. Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
4. Drag these files from `/Users/atakancamadan/Documents/GitHub/fedevent/`:
   - `prelaunch-server.js`
   - `package.json`
   - `render.yaml`
5. Drag `prelaunch.html` from the `public/` folder
6. Add commit message: "Add FEDEVENT prelaunch site"
7. Click **"Commit changes"**

✅ Done! Files are on GitHub

---

**Option B: Fix Git and Push (Advanced)**

If you want to fix the git corruption first:

```bash
cd /Users/atakancamadan/Documents/GitHub/fedevent

# Backup first
cp -r .git .git.backup

# Remove corrupted index
rm -f .git/index

# Rebuild from HEAD
git reset --hard HEAD

# If that fails, see ALTERNATIVE_DEPLOYMENT.md for more options
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click **"Get Started"** or **"Sign In"**
3. Choose **"Sign in with GitHub"**
4. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
5. Find and connect your `fedevent` repository

   ```
   Name: fedevent-prelaunch
   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: node prelaunch-server.js
   Instance Type: Free (or Starter $7/month)
   ```

7. Add Environment Variables (click "Add Environment Variable" for each):
   ```
   NODE_ENV = production
   SMTP_HOST = smtpout.secureserver.net
   SMTP_PORT = 465
   SMTP_SECURE = true

   SMTP_PASS = [your GoDaddy password]
   NOTIFY_TO = admin@creata.com
   NOTIFY_FROM = noreply@fedevent.com
   ```

8. Click **"Create Web Service"**
9. Wait 2-5 minutes for deployment

✅ Your site will be live!

### Step 3: Test Your Deployment (5 minutes)

Once Render shows "Live", test these URLs:

**Health Check:**
```
https://fedevent-prelaunch.onrender.com/api/health
```
Should return: `{"ok": true, "status": "healthy", ...}`

**Prelaunch Page:**
```
https://fedevent-prelaunch.onrender.com/prelaunch.html
```
Should show: FEDEVENT prelaunch page with flags 🇺🇸 🇺🇳

**Submit Test Lead:**
1. Fill out the form
2. Click "Join the Waitlist"
3. Should see success message with user code (FEV-XXXXX)

- Likely filesystem or hardware issue
- Does NOT affect your code files (they're perfect!)

**Solution:**
- Use GitHub web interface to upload files
- Or follow git repair instructions in ALTERNATIVE_DEPLOYMENT.md
- Or create a fresh repository clone

**Should you fix it:**
- Optional for now (web upload works fine)
- Fix later when you have time
- Consider running disk utility to check for hardware issues
