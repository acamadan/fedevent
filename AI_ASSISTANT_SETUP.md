## Quick Start

### 1. Verify OpenAI API Key

Make sure your `.env` file has the OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

If not set, run:
```bash
./setup-openai.sh
# or on Windows:
# setup-openai.bat
```

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on port **7070**.

### 3. Test the AI Assistant

Run the test script:
```bash
npm run test:assistant
```

This will test 5 common questions and verify everything is working.

### 4. Try It Live

1. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:7070/hotel-registration.html**
2. Look for the **blue AI chat bubble** in the bottom-right corner (with a pulsing animation)
3. Click the bubble to open the chat panel
4. Try asking questions like:
   - "How do I fill out this registration form?"
   - "What are the NET30 payment terms?"
   - "Do I need SAM.gov registration?"
   - "Can I contact the government directly?"

### 5. Test Form Field Detection

1. Click on any input field in the registration form
2. Notice the chat bubble shows a tooltip: "Need help with [field name]? Click me!"
3. Click the bubble and ask about that specific field

## Features Demonstration

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: New Hotel Registration

**User**: "I want to join your network. How do I start?"

**AI**: "Welcome! I'm excited to help you join CREATA's Preferred Vendor Network. Here's the registration process:

**Step 1: Check Requirements**
- AAA 2+ Diamond rating (required)
- Indoor facilities only
- Must accept NET30 payment terms
- Must accept government purchase orders

**Step 2: Complete Registration Form**
Visit our hotel registration page and provide:
- Hotel information (name, address, contact)
- Room details (types, counts, capacities)
- Meeting spaces (names, setups, capacities)
- Amenities and services
- Required documents (licenses, insurance)

**Step 3: Submit & Wait**
- We review within 2-4 business days
- You'll receive email notification
- Once approved, you're added to our network

**Important**: As a hotel partner, you'll be a subcontractor under CREATA (the prime contractor). This means:
- You invoice CREATA directly (not the government)
- NET30 payment terms apply (mandatory)
- NO SAM.gov registration required for you

Would you like me to guide you through the registration form step-by-step?"

### Example 2: Payment Terms Clarification

**User**: "When will I get paid?"

**AI**: "Great question! Here's how payment works under NET30 terms:

**Payment Flow:**
1. You provide services and invoice CREATA directly
2. CREATA invoices the U.S. government
3. Government reviews and approves CREATA's invoice (2-3 weeks typically)
4. Once government payment received and cleared, CREATA releases funds to you
5. Payment released within 30 days of government payment clearance

**Timeline:**
- Government processing: 2-3 weeks
- NET30 after government approval
- Total time: Approximately 5-7 weeks from invoice submission

**Critical Points:**
- NO deposits or upfront payments permitted
- You must wait for government to pay CREATA first
- This protects both parties and ensures compliance
- All federal contracts operate this way

**Why NET30?**
This is a federal requirement that ensures proper accountability and prevents fraud in government contracting.

Need more details about the payment process?"

### Example 3: Form Field Help

**User**: "What should I put in the 'Meeting Spaces' section?"

**AI**: "Let me explain the Meeting Spaces section - this is crucial for government bookings!

**What to Include:**
1. **Space Name**: e.g., "Grand Ballroom", "Conference Room A"
2. **Square Footage**: Exact measurements if available
3. **Maximum Capacity**: How many people it can hold
4. **Setup Styles**: Check all that apply:
   - Theater style
   - Classroom style
   - Boardroom
   - U-shape
   - Banquet rounds
   - Reception/cocktail

**Why This Matters:**
Government events often have specific space requirements. Accurate information helps us match your hotel to relevant opportunities.

**Tips:**
- Be specific and accurate
- Include all available spaces (even smaller breakout rooms)
- Update capacity numbers regularly
- Mention special features (AV equipment, natural light, etc.)

**Example Entry:**
```
Name: Executive Boardroom
Size: 600 sq ft
Capacity: 20 people (boardroom), 30 (theater)
Setups: Boardroom, U-shape, Theater
Features: Built-in AV, whiteboard, natural lighting
```

Would you like help with any other sections of the form?"

## Troubleshooting

### Chat Bubble Not Appearing

**Issue**: No chat bubble visible on the page

**Solutions**:
1. Check if `chat.js` is loaded: View page source, search for "chat.js"
2. Open browser console (F12), look for JavaScript errors
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### AI Not Responding

**Issue**: Chat bubble works but no responses

**Solutions**:
1. Verify server is running: `npm start`
2. Check server logs for errors: `tail -f server.log`
3. Test OpenAI API key: `npm run test:openai`
4. Check OpenAI service status: https://status.openai.com
5. Verify `.env` has valid API key

### Slow Responses

**Issue**: AI takes too long to respond

**Possible Causes**:
- High OpenAI API load (peak times)
- Internet connection issues
- Server resource constraints
- Large conversation history

**Solutions**:
- Wait a bit longer (first response may be slower)
- Clear conversation history (close/reopen chat)
- Check your internet speed
- Consider upgrading server resources

### Incorrect Answers

**Issue**: AI gives wrong or outdated information

**Solutions**:
1. Update knowledge base in `server.js`
2. Increase token limit for more detailed responses
3. Adjust temperature setting (lower = more focused)
4. Test with more specific questions
