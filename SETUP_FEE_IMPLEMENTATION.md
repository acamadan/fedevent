```

#### Step 2: Contact the Hotel

- Phone: Take card details over phone
- Email: Send QuickBooks invoice
- They already received payment instructions

#### Step 3: Process Payment in QuickBooks
Use your existing QuickBooks process:
- Create invoice or charge directly

- Save the transaction ID

#### Step 4: Mark as Paid in Admin Dashboard
1. Go to: `https://fedevent.com/admin-payments.html`
2. Find the registration
3. Click "Mark as Paid"
4. (Optional) Enter QuickBooks invoice/payment ID
5. (Optional) Add note (e.g., "Paid via phone - credit card")
6. Click "Confirm Payment & Activate Account"

#### Step 5: Done!
✓ Account automatically activated
✓ Hotel receives confirmation email
✓ Hotel can now access dashboard and complete profile

## 📧 Email Setup (Required)

Make sure your `.env` file has SMTP configured:

```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Admin Email (where notifications go)
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin@fedevent.com
```

**Without SMTP:** System will still work, but no emails will be sent. You'll need to manually check the database.

## 📊 Admin Dashboard

Access: `https://fedevent.com/admin-payments.html`

Features:
- **Real-time stats**: Pending payments, total amount, today's registrations
- **Quick view**: All pending payments at a glance
- **One-click action**: Mark payments as paid instantly
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Email links**: Click to email hotels directly

## 💾 Database Structure

### Users Table (Updated)
```sql
account_status: 'pending' | 'active'
setup_fee_paid: 0 | 1
```

### Payments Table (New)
```sql
- id: Payment ID
- user_id: Link to user
- amount: $49.99
- status: 'pending' | 'paid'
- payment_method: 'quickbooks'
- quickbooks_invoice_id: (optional)
- quickbooks_payment_id: (optional)
- transaction_note: (optional)
- paid_at: Timestamp
- created_at: Timestamp
```

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Restart Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Test the Flow
1. Go to `/hotel-signup.html`
2. Complete registration form
3. Check your email for admin notification
4. Go to `/admin-payments.html`
5. Mark payment as paid
6. Verify hotel receives activation email

## 📝 Customization Options

### Change Setup Fee Amount

In `server.js` (line ~3905):
```javascript
VALUES (?, 49.99, 'pending', 'quickbooks')
```

And update the display text in:
- `/public/hotel-signup.html` (line ~505)
- Email templates in `server.js`

### Change Payment Terms

Edit the setup fee notice in `/public/hotel-signup.html` around line 498-532.

### Customize Emails

Edit email templates in `server.js`:
- Welcome email with payment instructions (line ~3920)
- Admin notification email (line ~4002)
- Activation confirmation email (line ~4217)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- ✅ Accounts created as "pending" cannot access full features until activated
- ✅ Admin endpoints protected with `requireAuth` and `requireAdmin`
- ✅ Payment processing requires admin authentication
- ✅ No credit card data stored (handled by QuickBooks)

## 📞 Support Workflow

### If Hotel Doesn't Pay:
1. System automatically emails them payment instructions
2. You receive their contact info
3. You can follow up manually
4. Account remains pending until payment

### If Payment Issues:
1. Hotel contacts you
2. You can send invoice via QuickBooks
3. Or take payment over phone
4. Mark as paid in admin dashboard

### Refund Process:
1. Process refund in QuickBooks
2. In admin dashboard (you'll need to add this feature later):
   - Change payment status back to "pending"
   - Or delete account entirely

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2: Automated Invoicing
- Integrate QuickBooks API
- Auto-create invoices on registration
- Webhook for payment confirmation
- Zero manual work

### Phase 3: Online Payment
- Add Stripe or QuickBooks payment form
- Instant account activation
- Better user experience

### Current Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL
The manual process works perfectly for getting started. You can upgrade to automation later when volume increases.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No pending payments showing"
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM payments WHERE status='pending'`
- Verify admin authentication
- Check console for errors

### "Emails not sending"
- Verify SMTP configuration in `.env`
- Check server logs for email errors
- Test with: `node test-email.js` (you may need to create this)

### "Payment marked as paid but account not active"
- Check database: `SELECT account_status, setup_fee_paid FROM users WHERE id=X`
- Should show: `active`, `1`
- Check server logs for errors

### "Can't access admin dashboard"
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Check your user role in database: `SELECT role FROM users WHERE email='your-email@fedevent.com'`
- Should be: `admin`

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Conversion Rate**: Registrations vs Payments
- **Payment Speed**: How long until hotels pay
- **Follow-up Needed**: Pending >24hrs

### Daily Routine:
1. Check `/admin-payments.html` in morning
2. Follow up on pending payments >24hrs
3. Mark payments as paid when received
4. Monitor activation emails sent
